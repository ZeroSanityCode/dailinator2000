Record and Replay your keyboard and mouse pressess.

I made these dumb scripts because I'm too lazy to do dailies in Gacha games.


You can record your keyboard pressess and mouse clicks with the "record_with_this.py" script. 

You can then replay what you've recorded with the "replay_with_this.py" script.


Make sure to run it as an Administrator or it might not work.

Also, I'm not a programmer, I'm just a random idot who knows a little bit of coding. 

So run this at your own risk, I take no responsibilty for what happens.
